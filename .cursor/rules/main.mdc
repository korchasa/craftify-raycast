# Goal

You are developing the Craftify project.

Craftify is a set of useful tools to boost productivity directly in Raycast. The extension uses OpenAI and other LLMs for translation, correction, explanation, and summarization of text, as well as for working with YouTube subtitles.

## Main libraries used and their documentation

- @raycast/api https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference — Raycast API for creating extensions
- youtube-transcript https://www.npmjs.com/package/youtube-transcript — Getting subtitles from YouTube
- @agentic/stdlib https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agentic/stdlib — Utilities for working with LLMs and agents

## Features

- Translation of text between languages (Russian, English, Bulgarian, Ukrainian)
- Correction of errors in text
- Explanation of complex texts in simple words
- Summarization of long texts
- Downloading and translating subtitles from YouTube
