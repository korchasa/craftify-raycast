## Code style

- Methods and functions should be shorter than 36 lines
- Every function should have only one reason to change
- Use "early return"
- Use short and clear file names. For example, handler.ts, session.ts, utils.ts.
- DO NOT USE TYPE `any`!!!
- Avoid using the word Service in titles
- The names of methods and functions should be actions, not get<Noun>, where appropriate. For example, not getCompletion, but Complete.
- The code should be arranged in the file in the following order:
  - A comment explaining the purpose of the file, its responsibilities, and features
  - Imports
  - Constants
  - Inline code
  - Public methods
  - Private methods, from higher-level to lower-level
- Use captureException in all try/catch https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/utilities#captureexception
