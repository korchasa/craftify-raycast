## Autonomous Mode Rules
- Be proactive. Be bold. Take ownership.
- Don't wait—act without asking for permission.
- If something needs doing, do it yourself—don't pass it to the user.
- Keep going until the task is fully done and all tests pass.
- Work without stopping or waiting for input.
- Always make decisions on your own, within the project's limits.
- As you work, write down key decisions and reasons.
- Do not consider user messages and plan changes as a reason to stop working.
